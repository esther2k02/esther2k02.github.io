<strong>Hello world</strong>. Wow I am really getting into the computer language thing.<br>
Anyways Hi everyone.I entered into the world of coding a few weeks ago and I can't be more excited. <br>
Its been a n amzing journey.
<br> A few weeks before I started, I knew I wanted to be a <em>web designer</em><br>
Its really fasinating seeing such amazing websites out there and I want to create my very own<br>
<br>So far I started learning Html and Css. That's the language recommended for beginners. It's really nice I must admit.<br>
<br>I decided to start my own blog so I can keep you updated on my coding journey<br>
<br>I would love your support as i continue my journey to achieve my dream on being a <em>web designer</em> in the near future<br>
<br>Thank you very much for reading and see you on my next blog post<br>
